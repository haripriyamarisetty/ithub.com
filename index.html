                        required to play a new role by harnessing more power of ICT based services so that it can lead towards a more
                        citizen friendly &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;administrative system. From the experiences of various nations, it has been found that the
                        marginalisation of people in governance process is related to the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;backwardness and slow progress. Hence, the idea
                        of good governance promotes the idea of participation of the citizens in the governance process to provide a
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;transparent and responsive administrative system. For this noble purpose ICT has been used as a tool to bring
